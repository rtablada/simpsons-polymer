Simpsons Polymer Elements
---

After seeing the incredible work of [Christopher Pattle](https://github.com/pattle) and his [Simpsons in CSS](http://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/) I was inspired to create [Polymer](www.polymer-project.org) components out of his work.

This is meant as a learning tool to get started with Polymer.
All credit goes out to Chris Pattle for his work creating the markup and CSS for these awesome components and the Polymer team for making it crazy simple for me to take his work and build web-components out of it!
